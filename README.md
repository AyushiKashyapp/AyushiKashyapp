- 👋 Hi, I’m Ayushi Kashyap, a data enthusiast with a penchant for turning raw numbers into meaningful insights. Whether I’m wrangling messy datasets or fine-tuning machine learning models, I’m in my element.

- 👀 I’m interested in:

  Data Exploration: I love unearthing hidden patterns and stories from data. EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) is like solving a captivating mystery—one scatter plot at a time.

  Machine Learning: From regression to neural networks, I’m fascinated by the magic of algorithms. Predictive modeling? Count me in!

  Natural Language Processing (NLP): Because understanding text isn’t just about parsing words; it’s about deciphering human intent.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning:

  Natural Language Processing: Deriving insights from texts. 

  Knowledge Graphs: Creating knowledge graphs from both structered and unstructerd data.

- 💞️ Let’s build something awesome together! If you’re working on a data-driven project or just want to chat about the latest Kaggle competition, reach out. You can find me here:
